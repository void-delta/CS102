Question 1
You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. 
At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.
You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is 
the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

An integer x: Record a new score of x.
'+': Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
'D': Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
'C': Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.


Question 2
You are given the Instagram post caption of a popular influencer which contains hashtags. 
   In one operation, you can: 
   ● Choose a hash in the caption. 
   ● Remove the closest non-hash character to its left, as well as remove the hash symbol itself. 
   Print the caption after all hashes have been removed.


Question 3
The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, 
referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. 
Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.
The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. 
The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:

    >If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, 
     they will take it and leave the queue.
    >Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.
    >This continues until none of the queue students want to take the 
     top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the 
type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the 
preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). 
Return the number of students that are able to eat.

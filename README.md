Learning the data structures in this course and trying out and experimenting to learn them

Although this course is basic, it is the primary requirement for proceding in our journey in Computer Science.

It is going to be an Odyssey of a Lifetime, just start walking. A great prose of the great poem Ulysses, will help you to get a move on.



                Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;

                Death closes all: but something ere the end,

                Some work of noble note, may yet be done,

                Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.

      The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:

      The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep

      Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,

      'T is not too late to seek a newer world.

                Push off, and sitting well in order smite

                The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds

                To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths

                Of all the western stars, until I die.

      It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:

      It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,

      And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

      Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'

                We are not now that strength which in old days

                Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;

                One equal temper of heroic hearts,

          Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

          To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

                  - Ulysses by Alfred, Lord Tennyson

This course is primarily focused on learning Data Structures in C language. 
The learning method is quite simple, theory is discussed in class and some problems are tackled in the class. These problems can be found in the ->Class Problems Section<-

Then the Laboratory Questions are given to us to solve in a 2 hour session, shich we usually overshoot, and solve in our free time. Thes can be accessed through Lab wise folders. The lab questions ar usually very good and can be considered a steep learning curve starting at the very basic and going to a good level. Highly recommend to checkout.

Next comes the Tutorial Questions, which are peer discussed and explained in the class by a student. These can be found by thier names and indexing, the questions will be on the top of the code commented. Thes can be ranging from great to basic.

Be sure to follow these programs.
